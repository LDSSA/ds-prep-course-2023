    "The field of [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) is all about writing code in a systematic and structured way and writing functions is the most fundamental tool we have to achieve this. There are some features of the Python programming language that directly affect how you write functions and, thus, how you engineer your software. **Scope** and **positional/keyword function arguments** are two of the most important of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, like any programming language, Python has a set of **built-in** functions that have already been written and are ready for use. We'll go through a few of them and tell you how to find more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll look at more sophisticated ways to **return** function outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, an important part of writing code is **documenting** what it does. Without it, you wouldn't have at your disposal all the beautiful [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.8/index.html)."
