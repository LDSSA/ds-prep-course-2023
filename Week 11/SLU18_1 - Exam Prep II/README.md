# SLU18_1 - Exam Prep II

This learning unit is for you to practice solving the previous entry exams of the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy.

The SLU18_1 contains one exercise notebook with all the questions from the wave 2 entry exam of batch 3 of LDSSA.

You can solve the exam just like a normal exercise notebook or you can pretend that it's an exam. In the second case, it's advisable to find some distraction-free time.
