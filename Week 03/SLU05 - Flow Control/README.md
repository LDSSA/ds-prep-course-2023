# Small Learning Unit 05 - Flow Control

In this Learning Unit, We'll learn how to control the execution of your code and harness the power of programming!

We'll start by reviewing and expanding our knowledge of booleans. These are going to be used next to control which part of your code is executed.

We'll then be (healthily) lazy and tell Python to repeat code without writing the same statement over and over again.

We'll conclude with a new method of building lists.

After going through the Learning Notebooks you should try your new skills in the Practice Notebook before heading to the Exercise Notebook!
This chapter is a big step forward in your programming journey and it might take a bit more effort than the previous chapters. The Practice Notebook, even though ungraded, is meant to help you get more comfortable with Flow Control in Python and be more at ease when solving the Exercise Notebook.
