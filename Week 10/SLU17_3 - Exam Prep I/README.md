# SLU17_3 - Exam Prep I

This learning unit is for you to practice solving the previous entry exams of the [Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy](https://www.lisbondatascience.org/starters-academy/).

The SLU17_3 contains one exercise notebook with all the questions from the wave 2 entry exam of batch 06 of LDSSA.

You can solve the exam just like a normal exercise notebook or you can pretend that it's an exam. To make it more real this time, we allocated 3 hours of time for the exam today and an office hour afterwards where you can talk to us about any doubts you have. Good luck!
