# SLU17_2 - Exam Prep I

This learning unit is for you to practice solving the previous entry exams of the [Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy](https://www.lisbondatascience.org/starters-academy/).

The SLU17_2 contains one exercise notebook with all the questions from the entry exam of batch 2 of LDSSA.

You can solve the exam just like a normal exercise notebook or you can pretend that it's an exam. In the second case, it's advisable to find some distraction-free time.
