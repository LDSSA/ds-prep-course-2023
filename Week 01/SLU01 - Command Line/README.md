## Welcome to SLU01 - Command Line

In this learning unit, you will get more familiar with your new working environment - the terminal and the command line.

You have been using the terminal with the command line during the setup and you will continue to use it throughout the course, at least for interactions with git. The commands used on the command line are from a language called shell, in our case the bash shell. Shell is a language providing command line user interface on Unix-like operating systems like Ubuntu or MacOS. Put simply, you can talk to the operating system in this language. In this SLU you will learn about the following bash commands:

- `pwd`: print working directory
- `ls`: list directory contents
- `man`, `--help`: access the manual page of a command
- `cd`: change directory
- `mkdir`: create directory
- `touch`: modify the timestamp of a file, can be used to create a new file without content
- `file`: detect the file type
- `cp`: copy files and directories
- `mv`: move / rename files and directories
- `rm`: remove files and directories
- `cat`, `head`, `tail`: concatenate files and print on the standard output
