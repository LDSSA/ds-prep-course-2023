    "A [command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) receives commands in the form of lines of text. You have used a command line interface during the setup in the terminal window. Instead of using a mouse and clicking on icons or button, you've written your orders to the computer on the command line. As an old IT joke goes, when you're a child, you communicate by pointing at things, and when you grow up, you learn how to write.\n",

    "The software which handles the interface and translates the written commands to machine code is called a command-line interpreter, command-line processor or [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)). It is basically a simple programming language. Beside basic operations such as copying or renaming files, it allows you to execute operations not available in GUIs, e.g. copy all files that start with a certain letter or rename files according to some rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix-like operating systems (like Mac OS or Ubuntu) implement a command-line interface for interactive access to operating system functions or services. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.  There are many flavours of shell. Ubuntu's default shell is [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) shell and MacOS shell is [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell).\n",
