# Small Learning Unit 02 - Programming Basics

## What is in this SLU?

In this Learning Unit, you'll be introduced to the world of Python programming. You'll start by learning what programming is and where to look for additional materials. We'll show you how to check your code for errors and how to understand some of the error messages. Part of this is to learn to use the `print()` function to your advantage. You'll also see how to comment your code to improve readability.

Then the interesting part: basic data types and operations. You'll see how to use several data types and the respective operations to manipulate data and obtain the results that you want. You'll be introduced to the concept of *operator precedence*.

Last but definitely not the least, you'll store the results of your calculations inside variables for later use.

I hope that you enjoy the ride and have fun.
