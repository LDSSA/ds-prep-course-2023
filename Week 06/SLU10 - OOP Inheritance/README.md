# Welcome to SLU10 - OOP Inheritance

## What is in this SLU?

The main goal for this Learning Unit is to further develop your Python Class knowledge, studying the following topics:
- Parent Class
- Child Class
- Inheritance
- Overriding
- `Isinstance` function

Keep in mind that this is only a fraction of the existing material on Python Object Oriented Programming. 
So, if you have the time, it is always important to keep on exploring this language. For sure you won't regret it. :)

Here is the link for the official Python documentation on classes (thus on inheritance), although with a more technical approach it has literally everything:
- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#

## How to go through this SLU?
You are probably already familiar with the process but in case you aren't these are the steps for this SLU:

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2023/blob/main/weekly-workflow.md#weekly-workflow) to set up your environment.
2. Go through the Learning Notebook.
3. Solve the Exercise notebook.
4. Submit the Exercises notebook as described in the Step 5 in [this section](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2023/blob/main/weekly-workflow.md#13-work-on-the-learning-units).

## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, be it about Learning Notebooks, Exercises, or anything else. Please check the [How to Ask for Help](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2023/blob/main/slack.md), and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!
