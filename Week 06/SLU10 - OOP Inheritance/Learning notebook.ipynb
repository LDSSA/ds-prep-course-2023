    "As you may noticed, in SLU09 you defined classes without the need for parenthesis in the class definition line. Now, as you just saw, when inheritance is required, the parent class is passed to the sub-class as a parameter between parentheses in the sub-class definition line. (This is actually the same syntax used in parameter function definition which makes sense since it is the same abstract action, only this time inheritance exclusively related). This fact may lead to the conclusion that SLU09‚Äôs classes don‚Äôt inherit ‚Äúanything from anywhere‚Äù however this is not correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the time to tell you that the expressions used to define classes in SLU09 are actually a Python 3.x simplification. Without getting too deep into version history, just keep in mind that in Python 3 the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "`class Robot:`\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python 2.x (from 2.2 onwards) the previous equivalence sequence is not true, because there are two ‚Äústyles‚Äù of classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"first style‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt have `<object>` as its base class (defined with `class Robot:`)\n",
    "- A \"second style‚Äù that inherits from the `<object>` base class (defined with `class Robot(object):`)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are significant differences at implementation and operational levels between this two \"styles\" of classes. As the community understood that `<object>` based classes were preferred \"99.99%\" of the time over \"non `<object>` based classes\" (easy speculation), the \"second style\" became the class standard and the language was simplified allowing the creation of classes that inherit from the `<object>` base class with the most simple expression possible, which is basically the reason you didn‚Äôt need to use parenthesis in SLU09.\n",
